/*
 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/GetThreadState/thrstat003.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test exercises JVMTI function GetThreadState.
 *     The test checks if the function returns:
 *       - NEW              if thread has not run yet
 *       - STATE_SLEEPING   if Thread.sleep() has been called
 *       - STATE_TERMINATED if thread has exited
 * COMMENTS
 *     Converted the test to use GetThreadState instead of GetThreadStatus.
 *     Ported from JVMDI.
 *
 * @requires vm.continuations
 * @library /test/lib
 * @compile --enable-preview -source ${jdk.version} thrstat03.java
 * @run main/othervm/native --enable-preview  -agentlib:thrstat03 thrstat03 5
