 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/MethodEntry/mentry001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test exercises JVMTI event callback function MethodEntry.
 *     The test checks the following:
 *       - if method and frame parameters of the function
 *         contain expected values for events generated upon entry
 *         of Java and native methods.
 *       - if GetFrameLocation indentifies the initial executable
 *         location in the method being entered.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Ported from JVMDI.
 *     Fixed the 5004632 bug.
 *
 * @library /test/lib
