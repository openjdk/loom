 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, onload_only_caps, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test exercises the JVMTI event SingleStep.
 *     It verifies that this event can be enabled and disabled during
 *     program execution.
 *     The test works as follows. Breakpoint is set at special method
 *     'bpMethod()'. Upon reaching the breakpoint, agent enables SingleStep
 *     event generation. All the received events are counted. When the
 *     method 'bpMethod()' is leaved and accordingly, the program returns
 *     to the calling method 'runThis()', the agent disables the event
 *     generation.
 *     At least one SingleStep  event must be received for the each method
 *     mentioned above. Also after disabling the event no more events
 *     must be received.
 * COMMENTS
