/**
 * A memory layout can be used to describe the contents of a memory segment.
 * There are two leaves in the layout hierarchy, <em>value layouts</em>, which are used to represent values of given size and kind (see
 * {@link ValueLayout}) and <em>padding layouts</em> which are used, as the name suggests, to represent a portion of a memory
 * segment whose contents should be ignored, and which are primarily present for alignment reasons (see {@link MemoryLayout#paddingLayout(long)}).
 * Some common value layout constants are defined in the {@link ValueLayout} class.
 * <p>
 * More complex layouts can be derived from simpler ones: a <em>sequence layout</em> denotes a repetition of one or more
 * element layout (see {@link SequenceLayout}); a <em>group layout</em> denotes an aggregation of (typically) heterogeneous
 * member layouts (see {@link GroupLayout}).
 * <p>
 * Layouts can be optionally associated with a <em>name</em>. A layout name can be referred to when
 * constructing <a href="MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths"><em>layout paths</em></a>.
 * <p>
 * Consider the following struct declaration in C:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=c :
 * typedef struct {
 *     char kind;
 *     int value;
 * } TaggedValues[5];
 * }
 *
 * The above declaration can be modelled using a layout object, as follows:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * SequenceLayout taggedValues = MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(5,
 *     MemoryLayout.structLayout(
 *         ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE.withName("kind"),
 *         MemoryLayout.paddingLayout(24),
 *         ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("value")
 *     )
 * ).withName("TaggedValues");
 * }
 *
 * <h2 id="layout-align">Size, alignment and byte order</h2>
 *
 * All layouts have a size; layout size for value and padding layouts is always explicitly denoted; this means that a layout description
 * always has the same size in bits, regardless of the platform in which it is used. For derived layouts, the size is computed
 * as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>for a sequence layout <em>S</em> whose element layout is <em>E</em> and size is <em>L</em>,
 *     the size of <em>S</em> is that of <em>E</em>, multiplied by <em>L</em></li>
 *     <li>for a group layout <em>G</em> with member layouts <em>M1</em>, <em>M2</em>, ... <em>Mn</em> whose sizes are
 *     <em>S1</em>, <em>S2</em>, ... <em>Sn</em>, respectively, the size of <em>G</em> is either <em>S1 + S2 + ... + Sn</em> or
 *     <em>max(S1, S2, ... Sn)</em> depending on whether the group is a <em>struct</em> or an <em>union</em>, respectively</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, all layouts feature a <em>natural alignment</em> which can be inferred as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>for a padding layout <em>L</em>, the natural alignment is 1, regardless of its size; that is, in the absence
 *     of an explicit alignment constraint, a padding layout should not affect the alignment constraint of the group
 *     layout it is nested into</li>
 *     <li>for a value layout <em>L</em> whose size is <em>N</em>, the natural alignment of <em>L</em> is <em>N</em></li>
 *     <li>for a sequence layout <em>S</em> whose element layout is <em>E</em>, the natural alignment of <em>S</em> is that of <em>E</em></li>
 *     <li>for a group layout <em>G</em> with member layouts <em>M1</em>, <em>M2</em>, ... <em>Mn</em> whose alignments are
 *     <em>A1</em>, <em>A2</em>, ... <em>An</em>, respectively, the natural alignment of <em>G</em> is <em>max(A1, A2 ... An)</em></li>
 * </ul>
 * A layout's natural alignment can be overridden if needed (see {@link MemoryLayout#withBitAlignment(long)}), which can be useful to describe
 * hyper-aligned layouts.
 * <p>
 * All value layouts have an <em>explicit</em> byte order (see {@link java.nio.ByteOrder}) which is set when the layout is created.
 *
 * <h2 id="layout-paths">Layout paths</h2>
 *
 * A <em>layout path</em> originates from a <em>root</em> layout (typically a group or a sequence layout) and terminates
 * at a layout nested within the root layout - this is the layout <em>selected</em> by the layout path.
 * Layout paths are typically expressed as a sequence of one or more {@link PathElement} instances.
 * <p>
 * Layout paths are for example useful in order to obtain {@linkplain MemoryLayout#bitOffset(PathElement...) offsets} of
 * arbitrarily nested layouts inside another layout, to quickly obtain a {@linkplain #varHandle(PathElement...) memory access handle}
 * corresponding to the selected layout, or to {@linkplain #select(PathElement...) select} an arbitrarily nested layout inside
 * another layout.
 * <p>
 * Such <em>layout paths</em> can be constructed programmatically using the methods in this class.
 * For instance, given the {@code taggedValues} layout instance constructed as above, we can obtain the offset,
 * in bits, of the member layout named <code>value</code> in the <em>first</em> sequence element, as follows:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * long valueOffset = taggedValues.bitOffset(PathElement.sequenceElement(0),
 *                                           PathElement.groupElement("value")); // yields 32
 * }
 *
 * Similarly, we can select the member layout named {@code value}, as follows:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemoryLayout value = taggedValues.select(PathElement.sequenceElement(),
 *                                          PathElement.groupElement("value"));
 * }
 *
 * Layout paths can feature one or more <em>free dimensions</em>. For instance, a layout path traversing
 * an unspecified sequence element (that is, where one of the path component was obtained with the
 * {@link PathElement#sequenceElement()} method) features an additional free dimension, which will have to be bound at runtime.
 * This is important when obtaining a {@linkplain MethodHandles#memorySegmentViewVarHandle(ValueLayout) memory segment view var handle}
 * from layouts, as in the following code:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * VarHandle valueHandle = taggedValues.varHandle(PathElement.sequenceElement(),
 *                                                PathElement.groupElement("value"));
 * }
 *
 * Since the layout path constructed in the above example features exactly one free dimension (as it doesn't specify
 * <em>which</em> member layout named {@code value} should be selected from the enclosing sequence layout),
 * it follows that the var handle {@code valueHandle} will feature an <em>additional</em> {@code long}
 * access coordinate.
 *
 * <p>A layout path with free dimensions can also be used to create an offset-computing method handle, using the
 * {@link #bitOffset(PathElement...)} or {@link #byteOffsetHandle(PathElement...)} method. Again, free dimensions are
 * translated into {@code long} parameters of the created method handle. The method handle can be used to compute the
 * offsets of elements of a sequence at different indices, by supplying these indices when invoking the method handle.
 * For instance:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MethodHandle offsetHandle = taggedValues.byteOffsetHandle(PathElement.sequenceElement(),
 *                                                           PathElement.groupElement("kind"));
 * long offset1 = (long) offsetHandle.invokeExact(1L); // 8
 * long offset2 = (long) offsetHandle.invokeExact(2L); // 16
 * }
 *
 * @implSpec
 * Implementations of this interface are immutable, thread-safe and <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>.
