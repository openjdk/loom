/**
 * A <i>thread</i> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
 * virtual machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
 * execution running concurrently.
 *
 * <p> {@code Thread} provides a {@link Builder} and other APIs to create and
 * start threads that execute {@link Runnable} tasks. Starting a thread schedules
 * it to execute concurrently with the thread that caused it start. The newly
 * started thread invokes the task's {@link Runnable#run() run} method. Thread
 * defines the {@link #join() join} method to wait for a thread to terminate.
 *
 * <p> Threads have a unique {@linkplain #getId() identifier} and a {@linkplain
 * #getName() name}. The identifier is generated when a {@code Thread} is created
 * and cannot be changed. The thread name can be specified when creating a thread
 * or can be {@linkplain #setName(String) changed} at a later time.
 *
 * <p> Threads support {@link ThreadLocal} variables. These are variables that are
 * local to a thread, meaning a thread can have a copy of a variable that is set to
 * a value that is independent of the value set by other threads. Thread also supports
 * {@link InheritableThreadLocal} variables that are thread local variables that are
 * inherited from the parent thread. Thread supports a special inheritable thread
 * local for the thread {@linkplain #getContextClassLoader() context-class-loader}.
 *
 * <h2><a id="platform-threads">Platform threads</a></h2>
 * <p> {@code Thread} supports the creation of <i>platform threads</i> that are
 * typically mapped 1:1 to kernel threads scheduled by the operating system.
 * Platform threads will usually have a large stack and other resources that are
 * maintained by the operating system. Platforms threads are suitable for executing
 * all types of tasks but may be a limited resource.
 *
 * <p> Platform threads are designated <i>daemon</i> or <i>non-daemon</i> threads.
 * When the Java virtual machine starts up, there is usually one non-daemon
 * thread (the thread that typically calls the application's {@code main} method).
 * The Java virtual machine terminates when all started non-daemon threads have
 * terminated. Unstarted daemon threads do not prevent the Java virtual machine from
 * terminating. The Java virtual machine can also be terminated by invoking the
 * {@linkplain Runtime#exit(int)} method, in which case it will terminate even
 * if there are non-daemon threads still running.
 *
 * <p> In addition to the daemon status, platform threads have a {@linkplain
 * #getPriority() thread priority} and are members of a {@linkplain ThreadGroup
 * thread group}.
 *
 * <p> Platform threads get an automatically generated thread name by default.
 *
 * <h2><a id="virtual-threads">Virtual threads</a></h2>
 * <p> {@code Thread} also supports the creation of <i>virtual threads</i>.
 * Virtual threads are typically <i>user-mode threads</i> scheduled by the Java
 * virtual machine rather than the operating system. Virtual threads will typically
 * require few resources and a single Java virtual machine may support millions of
 * virtual threads. Virtual threads are suitable for executing tasks that spend most
 * of the time blocked, often waiting for I/O operations to complete. Virtual threads
 * are not intended for long running CPU intensive operations.
 *
 * <p> Virtual threads typically employ a small set of platform threads are use
 * as <em>carrier threads</em>. Locking and I/O operations are the <i>scheduling
 * points</i> where a carrier thread is re-scheduled from one virtual thread to
 * another. Code executing in a virtual thread will usually not be aware of the
 * underlying carrier thread, and in particular, the {@linkplain Thread#currentThread()}
 * method, to obtain a reference to the <i>current thread</i>, will return the {@code
 * Thread} object for the virtual thread, not the underlying carrier thread.
 *
 * <p> Virtual threads gets a fixed name by default.
 *
 * <h2>Creating and starting threads</h2>
 *
 * <p> As noted above, {@code Thread} defines a {@link Builder} API for creating and
 * starting threads. The {@link #ofPlatform()} and {@link #ofVirtual()} methods are
 * used to create builders for platform and virtual threads respectively.
 * The following are examples that use the builder:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   Runnable runnable = ...
 *
 *   // Start a daemon thread to run a task
 *   Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().daemon().start(runnable);
 *
 *   // Create an unstarted thread with name "duke", its start() method
 *   // must be invoked to schedule it to execute.
 *   Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().name("duke").unstarted(runnable);
 *
 *   // A ThreadFactory that creates daemon threads named "worker-0", "worker-1", ...
 *   ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofPlatform().daemon().name("worker-", 0).factory();
 *
 *   // Start a virtual thread to run a task
 *   Thread thread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(runnable);
 *
 *   // A ThreadFactory that creates virtual threads
 *   ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofVirtual().factory();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p> In addition to the builder, {@code Thread} defines (for historical and
 * customization reasons) public constructors for creating platform threads. Most
 * applications should have little need to use these constructors directly or
 * extend {@code Thread}. The constructors cannot be used to create virtual threads.
 *
 * <h2><a id="inheritance">Inheritance</a></h2>
 * Creating a {@code Thread} will inherit, by default, {@linkplain
 * ScopeLocal#inheritableForType(Class) inheritable-scope-local} variables, the initial
 * value of {@linkplain InheritableThreadLocal inheritable-thread-local} variables, and
 * a number of properties from the parent thread:
 * <ul>
 *     <li> Platform threads inherit the daemon status, priority, and thread-group.
 *     <li> Virtual threads are scheduled by the same scheduler as the parent thread
 *          when the parent thread is a virtual thread. Virtual threads use the default
 *          scheduler when the parent thread is a platform thread and the scheduler has
 *          not been selected.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.

     * high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
     * maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
     * value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).

     * <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will

     * The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
     * likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this

     *       uses of {@code stop} should be replaced by code that simply
     *       modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should
     *       stop running.  The target thread should check this variable
