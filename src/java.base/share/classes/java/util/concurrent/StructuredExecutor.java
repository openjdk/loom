/**
 * A basic API for <em>structured concurrency</em>. StructuredExecutor supports cases
 * where a task splits into several concurrent sub-tasks to be executed in their own
 * threads and where the sub-tasks must complete before the main task can continue.
 *
 * <p> <b>This API is still work in progress. It will probably be renamed and changed
 * to not implement Executor.</b>
 *
 * <h2>Basic usage</h2>
 *
 * StructuredExecutor defines the {@link #open() open} method to open a new executor,
 * the {@link #fork(Callable) fork} method to start a thread to execute a task, the {@link
 * #join() join} method to wait for all threads to finish, and the {@link #close() close}
 * method to close the executor. The API is intended to be used with the {@code
 * try-with-resources} construct. The intention is that code in the <em>block</em> uses
 * the {@code fork} method to fork threads to execute the sub-tasks, wait for the threads
 * to finish with the {@code join} method, and then <em>process the results</em>.
 * Processing of results may include handling or re-throwing of exceptions.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (var executor = StructuredExecutor.open()) {      // @highlight substring="open"
 *
 *         Future<String> future1 = executor.fork(task1);    // @highlight substring="fork"
 *         Future<String> future2 = executor.fork(task2);    // @highlight substring="fork"
 *
 *         executor.join();    // @highlight substring="join"
 *
 *         ... process results/exceptions ...
 *
 *     } // close // @highlight substring="close"
 * }
 * To ensure correct usage, the {@code join} and {@code close} methods may only be invoked
 * by the <em>executor owner</em> (the thread that opened the executor), and the {@code close}
 * method throws an exception after closing if the owner did not invoke the {@code join}
 * method after forking.
 *
 * <p> StructuredExecutor defines the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut down an
 * executor without closing it. Shutdown is useful for cases where a task completes with
 * a result (or exception) and the results of other unfinished tasks are no longer needed.
 * Invoking {@code shutdown} while the owner is waiting in the {@code join} method will cause
 * the {@code join} to wakeup. It also interrupts all unfinished threads and prevents new
 * threads from starting in the executor.
 *
 * <h2><a id="CompletionHandler">Completion handlers</a></h2>
 *
 * StructuredExecutor defines the 2-arg {@link #fork(Callable, CompletionHandler) fork}
 * method that executes a {@link CompletionHandler CompletionHandler} after a task completes.
 * A completion handler can be used to implement policy, collect results and/or exceptions,
 * and provide an API that makes available the outcome to the main task to process after the
 * {@code join} method. A completion handler may, for example, collect the results of tasks
 * that complete with a result and ignore tasks that fail. It may collect exceptions when
 * tasks fail. It may invoke the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut down the executor
 * and cause {@link #join() join} to wakeup when some condition arises.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (var executor = StructuredExecutor.open()) {
 *
 *         MyHandler<String> handler = ...
 *
 *         Future<String> future1 = executor.fork(task1, handler);
 *         Future<String> future2 = executor.fork(task2, handler);
 *
 *         executor.join();
 *
 *         // @highlight region
 *         ... invoke handler methods to obtain outcome, process results/exceptions, ...
 *         // @end
 *
 *     }
 * }
 *
 *  <h2><a id="BuiltinCompletionHandlers">ShutdownOnSuccess and ShutdownOnFailure</a></h2>
 *
 * StructuredExecutor defines two completion handlers that implement policy for two common
 * cases:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> {@link ShutdownOnSuccess ShutdownOnSuccess} captures the first result and shuts
 *   down the executor to interrupt unfinished threads and wakeup the owner. This handler
 *   is intended for cases where the result of any task will do ("invoke any") and where the
 *   results of other unfinished tasks are no longer needed. It defines methods to get the
 *   first result or throw an exception if all tasks fail.
 *   <li> {@link ShutdownOnFailure ShutdownOnFailure} captures the first exception and shuts
 *   down the executor. This handler is intended for cases where the results of all tasks
 *   are required ("invoke all"); if any task fails then the results of other unfinished tasks
 *   are no longer needed. If defines methods to throw an exception if any of the tasks fail.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> The following are two examples that use the built-in completion handlers. In both
 * cases, a pair of tasks are forked to fetch resources from two URL locations "left" and
 * "right". The first example creates a ShutdownOnSuccess object to capture the result of
 * the first task to complete normally, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the
 * executor. The main task waits in {@code join} until either task completes with a result
 * or both tasks fail. It invokes the handler's {@link ShutdownOnSuccess#result(Function)
 * result(Function)} method to get the captured result. If both tasks fail then this
 * method throws WebApplicationException with the exception from one of the tasks as the
 * cause.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (var executor = StructuredExecutor.open()) {
 *
 *         var handler = new ShutdownOnSuccess<String>();
 *
 *         executor.fork(() -> fetch(left), handler);
 *         executor.fork(() -> fetch(right), handler);
 *
 *         executor.join();
 *
 *         // @link regex="result(?=\()" target="ShutdownOnSuccess#result" :
 *         String result = handler.result(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *     }
 * }
 * The second example creates a ShutdownOnFailure operation to capture the exception of
 * the first task to fail, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the executor. The
 * main task waits in {@link #joinUntil(Instant)} until both tasks complete with a result,
 * either fails, or a deadline is reached. It invokes the handler's {@link
 * ShutdownOnFailure#throwIfFailed(Function) throwIfFailed(Function)} to throw an exception
 * when either task fails. This method is a no-op if no tasks fail. The main task uses
 * {@code Future}'s {@link Future#resultNow() resultNow()} method to retrieve the results.
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *    Instant deadline = ...
 *
 *    try (var executor = StructuredExecutor.open()) {
 *
 *         var handler = new ShutdownOnFailure();
 *
 *         Future<String> future1 = executor.fork(() -> query(left), handler);
 *         Future<String> future2 = executor.fork(() -> query(right), handler);
 *
 *         executor.joinUntil(deadline);
 *
 *         // @link substring="throwIfFailed" target="ShutdownOnFailure#throwIfFailed" :
 *         handler.throwIfFailed(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *         // both tasks completed successfully
 *         String result = Stream.of(future1, future2)
 *                 // @link substring="Future::resultNow" target="Future#resultNow" :
 *                 .map(Future::resultNow)
 *                 .collect(Collectors.join(", ", "{ ", " }"));
 *
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <h2>Tree structure</h2>
 *
 * A StructuredExecutor is conceptually a node in a tree. A thread started in executor
 * "A" may itself open a new executor "B", implicitly forming a tree where executor "A" is
 * the parent of executor "B". When nested, say where thread opens executor "B" and then
 * invokes a method that opens executor "C", then the enclosing executor "B" is conceptually
 * the parent of the nested executor "C". The tree structure supports the inheritance of
 * {@linkplain ScopeLocal scope-local} bindings. It also supports confinement checks.
 * The phrase "threads contained in the executor" in method descriptions means threads in
 * executors in the tree. StructuredExecutor does not define APIs that exposes the tree
 * structure at this time.
 *
 * <h2> Inheritance of scope-local bindings</h2>
 *
 * Creating a StructuredExecutor captures the {@linkplain ScopeLocal scope-local} bindings
 * for inheritance by threads created in the executor.
 *
 * The following example performs an operation with a scope local {@code NAME} bound to the
 * value "duke". The operation creates a {@code StructuredExecutor} that invokes {@code fork}
 * to start a thread to execute {@code childTask}. The code in {@code childTask} uses the
 * value of the scope-local and so reads the value "duke".
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     private static final ScopeLocal<String> NAME = ScopeLocal.newInstance();
 *
 *     // @link substring="where" target="ScopeLocal#where" :
 *     String result = ScopeLocal.where(NAME, "duke").call(() -> {  // @highlight substring="call"
 *         try (var executor = StructuredExecutor.open()) {
 *             executor.fork(() -> childTask());    // @highlight substring="fork"
 *             ...
 *         }
 *     });
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     String childTask() {
 *         String name = NAME.get();   // "duke"    // @highlight substring="get"
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.

     * A CompletionHandler is specified to the {@link #fork(Callable, CompletionHandler)
     * fork} method to execute after the task completes. It defines the {@link
     * #handle(StructuredExecutor, Future) handle} method to handle the completed task.
     * The {@code handle} method does not return a result, it is expected to operate via
     * side-effects.
     *
     * <p> A completion handler implements a policy on how tasks that complete normally and
     * abnormally are handled. It may, for example, collect the results of tasks that complete
     * with a result and ignore tasks that fail. It may collect exceptions when tasks fail. It
     * may invoke the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut down the executor and
     * cause {@link #join() join} to wakeup when some condition arises.
     *
     * <p> A completion handler will typically define methods to make available results, state,
     * or other outcome to code that executes after the {@code join} method. A completion
     * handler that collects results and ignores tasks that fail may define a method that
     * returns a possibly-empty collection of results. A completion handler that implements
     * a policy to shut down the executor when a task fails may define a method to retrieve
     * the exception of the first task to fail.
     *
     * <p> A completion handler implementation is required to be thread safe. The {@code
     * handle} method may be invoked by several threads at around the same time.
     *
     * <p> The {@link #compose(CompletionHandler, CompletionHandler) compose} method may be
     * used to compose more than one completion handler if required.
     *
     * <p> The following is an example of a completion handler that collects the results
     * of tasks that complete successfully. It defines a {@code results()} method for the
     * main task to invoke to retrieve the results.
