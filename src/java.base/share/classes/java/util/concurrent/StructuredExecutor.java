/**
 * A basic API for <em>structured concurrency</em>. StructuredExecutor supports cases
 * where a task splits into several concurrent sub-tasks to be executed in their own
 * threads and where the sub-tasks must complete before the main task can continue.
 *
 * <p> <b>StructuredExecutor is work-in-progress.</b>
 *
 * <p> StructuredExecutor defines the {@link #open() open} method to open a new executor,
 * the {@link #fork(Callable) fork} method to start a thread to execute a task, the {@link
 * #join() join} method to wait for all threads to finish, and the {@link #close() close}
 * method to close the executor. The API is intended to be used with the {@code
 * try-with-resources} construct. The intention is that code in the <em>block</em> uses
 * the {@code fork} method to fork threads to execute the sub-tasks, wait for the threads
 * to finish with the {@code join} method, and then <em>process the results</em>.
 * Processing of results may include handling or re-throwing of exceptions.
 * <pre>{@code
 *         try (var executor = StructuredExecutor.open()) {
 *             Future<String> future1 = executor.fork(task1);
 *             Future<String> future2 = executor.fork(task2);
 *
 *             executor.join();
 *
 *             ... process results/exceptions ...
 *
 *         }
 * }</pre>
 * To ensure correct usage, the {@code join} and {@code close} methods may only be invoked
 * by the <em>executor owner</em> (the thread that opened the executor), and the {@code close}
 * method throws an exception after closing if the owner did not invoke the {@code join}
 * method.
 *
 * <p> StructuredExecutor defines the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut down an
 * executor without closing it. Shutdown is useful for cases where a sub-task completes with
 * a result (or exception) and the results of other unfinished tasks are no longer needed.
 * Invoking {@code shutdown} while the owner is waiting in the {@code join} method will cause
 * the {@code join} to wakeup. It also interrupts all unfinished threads and prevents new
 * threads from starting in the executor.
 *
 * <p> StructuredExecutor defines the 2-arg {@link #fork(Callable, BiConsumer) fork} method
 * for cases where it is useful to execute an operation when a task completes. The operation
 * may queue or record results, it may shutdown the executor.
 * {@link ShutdownOnSuccess ShutdownOnSuccess} and {@link ShutdownOnFailure
 * ShutdownOnFailure} are two useful operations that capture the first result or
 * exception, then shutdown the executor to interrupt unfinished threads and wakeup the
 * owner.
 *
 * <p> The following are two examples that fork a pair of tasks in an executor to fetch
 * resources from two URL locations "left" and "right". The first creates a ShutdownOnSuccess
 * object to capture the result of the first task to complete normally, cancelling the other
 * by way of shutting down the executor. The main task waits in {@code join} until either
 * task completes with a result or both tasks fail.
 * <pre>{@code
 *         try (var executor = StructuredExecutor.open()) {
 *             var handler = new ShutdownOnSuccess<String>();
 *
 *             executor.fork(() -> fetch(left), handler);
 *             executor.fork(() -> fetch(right), handler);
 *
 *             executor.join();
 *
 *             String result = handler.result(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *             :
 *         }
 * }</pre>
 * The second creates a ShutdownOnFailure operation to capture the exception thrown by
 * the first task to fail, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the executor. The
 * main task waits in {@link #joinUntil(Instant)} until both tasks complete with a result,
 * either fails, or a deadline is reached.
 * <pre>{@code
 *        Instant deadline = ...
 *
 *        try (var executor = StructuredExecutor.open()) {
 *             var handler = new ShutdownOnFailure();
 *
 *             Future<String> future1 = executor.fork(() -> query(left), handler);
 *             Future<String> future2 = executor.fork(() -> query(right), handler);
 *
 *             executor.joinUntil(deadline);
 *
 *             handler.throwIfFailed(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *             // all tasks completed with a result
 *             String result = Stream.of(future1, future2)
 *                 .map(Future::resultNow)
 *                 .collect(Collectors.join(", ", "{ ", " }"));
 *
 *             :
 *         }
 * }</pre>
 * The example uses {@link Future#resultNow()} to obtain the result of each task. It
 * should be rare to need to use the {@link Future#get()} method to wait for a result
 * when using a StructuredExecutor.
 *
 * <p> A StructuredExecutor is conceptually a node in a tree. A thread started in executor
 * "A" may itself open a new executor "B", implicitly forming a tree where executor "A" is
 * the parent of executor "B". When nested, say where thread opens executor "B" and then
 * invokes a method that opens executor "C", then the enclosing executor "B" is conceptually
 * the parent of the nested executor "C". The tree structure supports the inheritance of
 * {@linkplain ScopeLocal scope-local} bindings. It also supports confinement checks.
 * The phrase "threads contained in the executor" in method descriptions means threads in
 * executors in the tree. StructuredExecutor does not define APIs that exposes the tree
 * structure at this time.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
