/**
 * A basic API for <em>structured concurrency</em>. StructuredTaskScope supports cases
 * where a task splits into several concurrent sub-tasks, to be executed in their own
 * threads, and where the sub-tasks must complete before the main task continues. A
 * StructuredTaskScope can be used to ensure that the lifetime of a concurrent operation
 * is confined by a <em>syntax block</em>, just like that of a sequential operation in
 * structured programming.
 *
 * <h2>Basic usage</h2>
 *
 * StructuredTaskScope defines the {@link #open() open} methods to open a new task scope,
 * the {@link #fork(Callable) fork} method to start a thread to execute a task, the {@link
 * #join() join} method to wait for all threads to finish, and the {@link #close() close}
  * method to close the task scope. The API is intended to be used with the {@code
 * try-with-resources} construct. The intention is that code in the <em>block</em> uses
 * the {@code fork} method to fork threads to execute the sub-tasks, wait for the threads
 * to finish with the {@code join} method, and then <em>process the results</em>.
 * Processing of results may include handling or re-throwing of exceptions.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (var scope = StructuredTaskScope.open()) {     // @highlight substring="open"
 *
 *         Future<String> future1 = scope.fork(task1);    // @highlight substring="fork"
 *         Future<String> future2 = scope.fork(task2);    // @highlight substring="fork"
 *
 *         scope.join();                                  // @highlight substring="join"
 *
 *         ... process results/exceptions ...
 *
 *     } // close                                         // @highlight substring="close"
 * }
 * To ensure correct usage, the {@code join} and {@code close} methods may only be invoked
 * by the <em>owner</em> (the thread that opened/created the StructuredTaskScope, and the
 * {@code close} method throws an exception after closing if the owner did not invoke the
 * {@code join} method after forking.
 *
 * <p> StructuredTaskScope defines the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut down a
 * task scope without closing it. Shutdown is useful for cases where a task completes with
 * a result (or exception) and the results of other unfinished tasks are no longer needed.
 * Invoking {@code shutdown} while the owner is waiting in the {@code join} method will cause
 * {@code join} to wakeup. It also interrupts all unfinished threads and prevents new threads
 * from starting in the task scope.
 *
 * <h2><a id="CompletionPolicy">Completion policy</a></h2>
 *
 * A StructuredTaskScope may be opened with a {@link CompletionPolicy CompletionPolicy} that
 * executes after each task completes. A completion policy can be used to implement policy,
 * collect results and/or exceptions, and provide an API that makes available the outcome to the
 * main task to process after the {@code join} method. A completion policy may, for example,
 * collect the results of tasks that complete with a result and ignore tasks that fail. It may
 * collect exceptions when tasks fail. It may invoke the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to
 * shut down the task scope and cause {@link #join() join} to wakeup when some condition arises.
 * CompletionPolicy extends {@link AutoCloseable} to allow a completion policy be declared in
 * the resource specification of a try-with-resources statement.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (CompletionPolicy<String> policy = ...               // @highlight substring="policy"
 *          var scope = StructuredTaskScope.open(policy)) {     // @highlight substring="policy"
 *
 *         Future<String> future1 = scope.fork(task1);
 *         Future<String> future2 = scope.fork(task2);
 *
 *         scope.join();
 *
 *         // @highlight region
 *         ... invoke policy methods to obtain outcome, process results/exceptions, ...
 *         // @end
 *
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <h2><a id="BuiltinCompletionPolicies">ShutdownOnSuccess and ShutdownOnFailure</a></h2>
 *
 * StructuredTaskScope defines two completion policies that implement policy for two common
 * cases:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> {@link ShutdownOnSuccess ShutdownOnSuccess} captures the first result and shuts
 *   down the task scope to interrupt unfinished threads and wakeup the owner. This policy
 *   is intended for cases where the result of any task will do ("invoke any") and where the
 *   results of other unfinished tasks are no longer needed. It defines methods to get the
 *   first result or throw an exception if all tasks fail.
 *   <li> {@link ShutdownOnFailure ShutdownOnFailure} captures the first exception and shuts
 *   down the task scope. This policy is intended for cases where the results of all tasks
 *   are required ("invoke all"); if any task fails then the results of other unfinished tasks
 *   are no longer needed. If defines methods to throw an exception if any of the tasks fail.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> The following are two examples that use the built-in completion policies. In both
 * cases, a pair of tasks are forked to fetch resources from two URL locations "left" and
 * "right". The first example creates a ShutdownOnSuccess object to capture the result of
 * the first task to complete normally, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the
 * task scope. The main task waits in {@code join} until either task completes with a result
 * or both tasks fail. It invokes the policy's {@link ShutdownOnSuccess#result(Function)
 * result(Function)} method to get the captured result. If both tasks fail then this
 * method throws WebApplicationException with the exception from one of the tasks as the
 * cause.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (var policy = new ShutdownOnSuccess<String>();
 *          var scope = StructuredTaskScope.open(policy)) {
 *
 *         scope.fork(() -> fetch(left));
 *         scope.fork(() -> fetch(right));
 *
 *         scope.join();
 *
 *         // @link regex="result(?=\()" target="ShutdownOnSuccess#result" :
 *         String result = policy.result(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 * The second example creates a ShutdownOnFailure operation to capture the exception of
 * the first task to fail, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the task scope. The
 * main task waits in {@link #joinUntil(Instant)} until both tasks complete with a result,
 * either fails, or a deadline is reached. It invokes the policy's {@link
 * ShutdownOnFailure#throwIfFailed(Function) throwIfFailed(Function)} to throw an exception
 * when either task fails. This method is a no-op if no tasks fail. The main task uses
 * {@code Future}'s {@link Future#resultNow() resultNow()} method to retrieve the results.
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *    Instant deadline = ...
 *
 *    try (var policy = new ShutdownOnFailure();
 *         var scope = StructuredTaskScope.open(policy)) {
 *
 *         Future<String> future1 = scope.fork(() -> query(left));
 *         Future<String> future2 = scope.fork(() -> query(right));
 *
 *         scope.joinUntil(deadline);
 *
 *         // @link substring="throwIfFailed" target="ShutdownOnFailure#throwIfFailed" :
 *         policy.throwIfFailed(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *         // both tasks completed successfully
 *         String result = Stream.of(future1, future2)
 *                 // @link substring="Future::resultNow" target="Future#resultNow" :
 *                 .map(Future::resultNow)
 *                 .collect(Collectors.joining(", ", "{ ", " }"));
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <h2><a id="TreeStructure">Tree structure</a></h2>
 *
 * StructuredTaskScopes form a tree where parent-child relations are established implicitly
 * when opening a new task scope:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> A parent-child relation is established when a thread started in a task scope opens
 *   its own task scope. A thread started in task scope "A" opens task scope "B" establishes
 *   a parent-child relation where task scope "A" is the parent of task scope "B".
 *   <li> A parent-child relation is established with nesting. If a thread opens task scope
 *   "B", then open task scope "C" (before it closes "B"), then the enclosing task scope "B"
 *   is the parent of the nested task scope "C".
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The tree structure supports:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Inheritance of {@linkplain ScopeLocal scope-local} bindings by threads.
 *   <li> Confinement checks. The phrase "threads contained in the task scope" in method
 *   descriptions means threads started in the task scope or descendant scopes.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The following example demonstrates the inheritance of a scope-local binding. A scope
 * local {@code NAME} is bound to the value "duke". A StructuredTaskScope is created and
 * its {@code fork} method invoked to start a thread to execute {@code childTask}. The thread
 * inherits the scope-local binding. The code in {@code childTask} uses the value of the
 * scope-local and so reads the value "duke".
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     private static final ScopeLocal<String> NAME = ScopeLocal.newInstance();
 *
 *     // @link regex="bind(?=\()" target="ScopeLocal#bind" :
 *     try (var binding = NAME.bind("duke"));
 *          var scope = StructuredTaskScope.open()) {
 *
 *         scope.fork(() -> childTask());           // @highlight substring="fork"
 *         ...
 *      }
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     String childTask() {
 *         String name = NAME.get();   // "duke"    // @highlight substring="get"
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <p> StructuredTaskScope does not define APIs that exposes the tree structure at this time.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 * @param <T> the result type of tasks executed in the scope
 * @since 99

     * An operation that implements a <em>completion policy</em>. A CompletionPolicy can be
     * specified when creating a {@link StructuredTaskScope} so that the {@link
     * #handle(StructuredTaskScope, Future) handle} method is invoked to consume each
     * completed task.
     *
     * <p> A CompletionPolicy implements policy on how tasks that complete normally and
     * abnormally are handled. It may, for example, collect the results of tasks that complete
     * with a result and ignore tasks that fail. It may collect exceptions when tasks fail. It
     * may invoke the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut down the task scope and
     * cause {@link #join() join} to wakeup when some condition arises.
     *
     * <p> A completion policy will typically define methods to make available results, state,
     * or other outcome to code that executes after the {@code join} method. A completion
     * policy that collects results and ignores tasks that fail may define a method that
     * returns a possibly-empty collection of results. A completion policy that implements
     * a policy to shut down the task scope when a task fails may define a method to retrieve
     * the exception of the first task to fail.
     *
     * <p> A completion policy implementation is required to be thread safe. The {@code
     * handle} method may be invoked by several threads at around the same time. The {@code
     * handle} method does not return a result, it is expected to operate via side-effects.
     *
     * <p> The {@link #compose(CompletionPolicy, CompletionPolicy) compose} method may be
     * used to compose more than one completion policy if required.
     *
     * <p> The following is an example of a completion policy that collects the results
     * of tasks that complete successfully. It defines the method <b>{@code results()}</b>
     * to be used by the main task to retrieve the results.
