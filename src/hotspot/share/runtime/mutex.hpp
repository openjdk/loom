// A Mutex/Monitor is a simple wrapper around a native lock plus condition
// variable that supports lock ownership tracking, lock ranking for deadlock
// detection and coordinates with the safepoint protocol.

// The default length of mutex name was originally chosen to be 64 to avoid
// false sharing. Now, PaddedMutex and PaddedMonitor are available for this purpose.

  // holding it, i.e., no vm operation can happen, taking other (blocking) locks, etc.
  // The rank 'access' is similar to 'special' and has the same restrictions on usage.
  // It is reserved for locks that may be required in order to perform memory accesses
  // that require special barriers, e.g. SATB GC barriers, that in turn uses locks.
  // The rank 'tty' is also similar to 'special' and has the same restrictions.
  // It is reserved for the tty_lock.
  // Since memory accesses should be able to be performed pretty much anywhere
  // in the code, that requires locks required for performing accesses being
  // inherently a bit more special than even locks of the 'special' rank.
  // NOTE: It is critical that the rank 'special' be the lowest (earliest)
  // (except for "event" and "access") for the deadlock detection to work correctly.
  // The rank native was only for use in Mutexes created by JVM_RawMonitorCreate,
  // which being external to the VM are not subject to deadlock detection,
  // however it has now been used by other locks that don't fit into the
  // deadlock detection scheme.
  // While at a safepoint no mutexes of rank safepoint are held by any thread.

  // be changed) -- mutexes of this rank aren't really leaf mutexes
