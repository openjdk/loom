// == Critical allocation support ==
//
// The critical allocation support has the purpose of preventing starvation of failed
// metadata allocations that need a GC, in particular for concurrent GCs.
// A "critical" allocation request is registered, then a concurrent full GC is executed.
// When there is any critical allocation present in the system, allocations compete for
// a global lock, so that allocations can be shut out from the concurrent purge() call,
// which takes the same lock. The reasoning is that we gather all the critical allocations
// that are one more failure away from throwing metaspace OOM, in a queue before the GC,
// then free up metaspace due to class unloading in the purge() operation of that GC,
// and satisfy the registered critical allocations. This allows the critical allocations
// to get precedence over normal metaspace allocations, so that the critical allocations
// that are about to throw, do not get starved by other metaspace allocations that have
// not gone through the same dance.
//
// The solution has an intended accuracy of not one allocation, but one per thread. What
// I mean by that, is that the allocations are allowed to throw if they got starved by
// one metaspace allocation per thread, even though a more complicated dance could have
// survived that situation in theory. The motivation is that we are at this point so close
// to being out of memory, and the VM is not having a good time, so the user really ought
// to increase the amount of available metaspace anyway, instead of GC:ing around more
// to satisfy a very small number of additional allocations. But it does solve pathologial
// unbounded starvation scenarios where OOM can get thrown even though most of metaspace
// is full of dead metadata.
//
// The contract for this to work for a given GC is that GCCause::_metadata_GC_clear_soft_refs
// yields a full synchronous GC that unloads metaspace. And it is only intended to be used
// by GCs with concurrent class unloading.
