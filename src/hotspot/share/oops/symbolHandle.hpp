// TempNewSymbol acts as a handle class in a handle/body idiom and is
// responsible for proper resource management of the body (which is a Symbol*).
// The body is resource managed by a reference counting scheme.
// TempNewSymbol can therefore be used to properly hold a newly created or referenced
// Symbol* temporarily in scope.
//
// Routines in SymbolTable will initialize the reference count of a Symbol* before
// it becomes "managed" by TempNewSymbol instances. As a handle class, TempNewSymbol
// needs to maintain proper reference counting in context of copy semantics.
//
// In SymbolTable, new_symbol() will create a Symbol* if not already in the
// symbol table and add to the symbol's reference count.
// probe() and lookup_only() will increment the refcount if symbol is found.
