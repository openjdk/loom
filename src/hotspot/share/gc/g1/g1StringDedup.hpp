//
// G1 string deduplication candidate selection
//
// An object is considered a deduplication candidate if all of the following
// statements are true:
//
// - The object is an instance of java.lang.String
//
// - The object is being evacuated from a young heap region
//
// - The object is being evacuated to a young/survivor heap region and the
//   object's age is equal to the deduplication age threshold
//
//   or
//
//   The object is being evacuated to an old heap region and the object's age is
//   less than the deduplication age threshold
//
// Once an string object has been promoted to an old region, or its age is higher
// than the deduplication age threshold, is will never become a candidate again.
// This approach avoids making the same object a candidate more than once.
