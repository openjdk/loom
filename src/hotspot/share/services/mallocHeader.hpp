/*
 * Malloc tracking header.
 *
 * If NMT is active (state >= minimal), we need to track allocations. A simple and cheap way to
 * do this is by using malloc headers.
 *
 * The user allocation is preceded by a header and is immediately followed by a (possibly unaligned)
 *  footer canary:
 *
 * +--------------+-------------  ....  ------------------+-----+
 * |    header    |               user                    | can |
 * |              |             allocation                | ary |
 * +--------------+-------------  ....  ------------------+-----+
 *     16 bytes              user size                      2 byte
 *
 * Alignment:
 *
 * The start of the user allocation needs to adhere to malloc alignment. We assume 128 bits
 * on both 64-bit/32-bit to be enough for that. So the malloc header is 16 bytes long on both
 * 32-bit and 64-bit.
 *
 * Layout on 64-bit:
 *
 *     0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
 * +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 * |                            64-bit size                                |  ...
 * +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *
 *           8        9        10       11       12       13       14       15          16 ++
 *       +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+  ------------------------
 *  ...  |   malloc site table marker        | flags  | unused |     canary      |  ... User payload ....
 *       +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+  ------------------------
 *
 * Layout on 32-bit:
 *
 *     0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
 * +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 * |            alt. canary            |           32-bit size             |  ...
 * +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *
 *           8        9        10       11       12       13       14       15          16 ++
 *       +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+  ------------------------
 *  ...  |   malloc site table marker        | flags  | unused |     canary      |  ... User payload ....
 *       +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+  ------------------------
 *
 * Notes:
 * - We have a canary in the two bytes directly preceding the user payload. That allows us to
 *   catch negative buffer overflows.
 * - On 32-bit, due to the smaller size_t, we have some bits to spare. So we also have a second
 *   canary at the very start of the malloc header (generously sized 32 bits).
 * - The footer canary consists of two bytes. Since the footer location may be unaligned to 16 bits,
 *   the bytes are stored individually.
