/**
 * An interface that models a variable argument list, similar in functionality to a C {@code va_list}.
 * <p>
 * A variable argument list is a stateful cursor used to iterate over a set of arguments. A variable argument list
 * can be passed by reference e.g. to a {@linkplain CLinker#downcallHandle(FunctionDescriptor) downcall method handle}.
 * <p>
 * Per the C specification (see C standard 6.5.2.2 Function calls - item 6),
 * arguments to variadic calls are erased by way of 'default argument promotions',
 * which erases integral types by way of integer promotion (see C standard 6.3.1.1 - item 2),
 * and which erases all {@code float} arguments to {@code double}.
 * <p>
 * As such, this interface only supports reading {@code int}, {@code double},
 * and any other type that fits into a {@code long}.
 *
 * This class is not thread safe, and all accesses should occur within a single thread
 * (regardless of the scope associated with the variable arity list).
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument, or an array argument containing one or more {@code null}
 * elements to a method in this class causes a {@link NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. </p>
