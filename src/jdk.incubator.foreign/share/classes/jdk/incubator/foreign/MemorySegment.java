/**
 * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
 * which falls <em>outside</em> the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal bounds ensure that memory access
 * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 * <p>
 * All implementations of this interface must be <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>;
 * programmers should treat instances that are {@linkplain #equals(Object) equal} as interchangeable and should not
 * use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may occur. For example, in a future release,
 * synchronization may fail. The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 * <p>
 * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument, or an array argument containing one or more {@code null}
 * elements to a method in this class causes a {@link NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. </p>
 *
 * <h2>Constructing memory segments</h2>
 *
 * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
 * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
 * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
 * in this way are called <em>native memory segments</em>.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
 * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
 * in this way are called <em>array memory segments</em>.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),
 * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.
 * Memory segments obtained in this way are called <em>buffer memory segments</em>. Note that buffer memory segments might
 * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),
 * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory
 * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed
 * by native memory.
 * <p>
 * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method
 * {@link MemorySegment#mapFile(Path, long, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called <em>mapped memory segments</em>;
 * mapped memory segments are associated with an underlying file descriptor. For more operations on mapped memory segments, please refer to the
 * {@link MappedMemorySegments} class.
 * <p>
 * Array and buffer segments are effectively <em>views</em> over existing memory regions which might outlive the
 * lifecycle of the segments derived from them, and can even be manipulated directly (e.g. via array access, or direct use
 * of the {@link ByteBuffer} API) by other clients. As a result, while sharing array or buffer segments is possible,
 * it is strongly advised that clients wishing to do so take extra precautions to make sure that the underlying memory sources
 * associated with such segments remain inaccessible, and that said memory sources are never aliased by more than one segment
 * at a time - e.g. so as to prevent concurrent modifications of the contents of an array, or buffer segment.
 *
 * <h2>Explicit deallocation</h2>
 *
 * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). When a segment is closed, it is no longer
 * <em>alive</em> (see {@link #isAlive()}, and subsequent operation on the segment (or on any {@link MemoryAddress} instance
 * derived from it) will fail with {@link IllegalStateException}.
 * <p>
 * Closing a segment might trigger the releasing of the underlying memory resources associated with said segment, depending on
 * the kind of memory segment being considered:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>closing a native memory segment results in <em>freeing</em> the native memory associated with it</li>
 *     <li>closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped</li>
 *     <li>closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
 *     as <em>not alive</em> (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
 *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
 *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
 *     objects.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2><a id = "access-modes">Access modes</a></h2>
 *
 * Memory segments supports zero or more <em>access modes</em>. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
 * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE}, {@link #SHARE} and {@link #HANDOFF}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the
 * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
 * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
 * <p>
 * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting <em>fewer</em> access modes). This means
 * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients
 * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment
 * is going to be accessed.
 *
 * <h2>Memory segment views</h2>
 *
 * Memory segments support <em>views</em>. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
 * by creating an <em>immutable</em> view of a memory segment, as follows:
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
MemorySegment segment = ...
MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() & ~WRITE);
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment
 * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
 * <p>
 * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
 * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
 * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
 * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}
 * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.
 * <p>
 * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
 * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
 * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
 * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory segment from which they originated.
 *
 * <h2><a id = "thread-confinement">Thread confinement</a></h2>
 *
 * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an <em>owner thread</em>,
 * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #handoff(Thread)} method can be used to change the thread-confinement properties of a memory segment.
 * This method is, like {@link #close()}, a <em>terminal operation</em> which marks the original segment as not alive
 * (see {@link #isAlive()}) and creates a <em>new</em> segment with the desired thread-confinement properties. Calling
 * {@link #handoff(Thread)} is only possible if the segment features the corresponding {@link #HANDOFF} access mode.
 * <p>
 * For instance, if a client wants to transfer ownership of a segment to another (known) thread, it can do so as follows:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
MemorySegment segment = ...
MemorySegment aSegment = segment.handoff(threadA);
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * By doing so, the original segment is marked as not alive, and a new segment is returned whose owner thread
 * is {@code threadA}; this allows, for instance, for two threads {@code A} and {@code B} to share
 * a segment in a controlled, cooperative and race-free fashion (also known as <em>serial thread confinement</em>).
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, the {@link #share()} method can be used to remove thread ownership altogether; this is only possible
 * if the segment features the corresponding {@link #SHARE} access mode. The following code shows how clients can
 * obtain a shared segment:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
MemorySegment segment = ...
MemorySegment sharedSegment = segment.share();
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * Again here, the original segment is marked as not alive, and a new <em>shared</em> segment is returned which features no owner
 * thread (e.g. {@link #ownerThread()} returns {@code null}). This might be useful when multiple threads need to process
 * the contents of the same memory segment concurrently (e.g. in the case of parallel processing). For instance, a client
 * might obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a shared segment, which can then be used to slice the segment and allow multiple
 * threads to work in parallel on disjoint segment slices. The following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
SequenceLayout SEQUENCE_LAYOUT = MemoryLayout.ofSequence(1024, MemoryLayouts.JAVA_INT);
try (MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(SEQUENCE_LAYOUT).share()) {
    VarHandle VH_int = SEQUENCE_LAYOUT.elementLayout().varHandle(int.class);
    int sum = StreamSupport.stream(segment.spliterator(SEQUENCE_LAYOUT), true)
                           .mapToInt(s -> (int)VH_int.get(s.address()))
                           .sum();
}
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * Once shared, a segment can be claimed back by a given thread (again using {@link #handoff(Thread)}); in fact, many threads
 * can attempt to gain ownership of the same segment, concurrently, and only one of them is guaranteed to succeed.
 * <p>
 * When using shared segments, clients should make sure that no other thread is accessing the segment while
 * the segment is being closed. If one or more threads attempts to access a segment concurrently while the
 * segment is being closed, an exception might occur on both the accessing and the closing threads. Clients should
 * refrain from attempting to close a segment repeatedly (e.g. keep calling {@link #close()} until no exception is thrown);
 * such exceptions should instead be seen as an indication that the client code is lacking appropriate synchronization between the threads
 * accessing/closing the segment.
 *
 * <h2>Implicit deallocation</h2>
 *
 * Clients can register a memory segment against a {@link Cleaner}, to make sure that underlying resources associated with
 * that segment will be released when the segment becomes <em>unreachable</em>, which can be useful to prevent native memory
 * leaks. This can be achieved using the {@link #registerCleaner(Cleaner)} method, as follows:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
MemorySegment segment = ...
MemorySegment gcSegment = segment.registerCleaner(cleaner);
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * Here, the original segment is marked as not alive, and a new segment is returned (the owner thread of the returned
 * segment set is set to that of the current thread, see {@link #ownerThread()}); the new segment
 * will also be registered with the the {@link Cleaner} instance provided to the {@link #registerCleaner(Cleaner)} method;
 * as such, if not closed explicitly (see {@link #close()}), the new segment will be automatically closed by the cleaner.
 *
 * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
 * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by other explicitly permitted subtypes.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * Implementations of this interface are immutable, thread-safe and <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>.
