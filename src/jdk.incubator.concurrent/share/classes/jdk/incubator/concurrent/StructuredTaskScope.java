/**
 * A basic API for <em>structured concurrency</em>. {@code StructuredTaskScope} supports
 * cases where a task splits into several concurrent subtasks, to be executed in their
 * own threads, and where the subtasks must complete before the main task continues. A
 * {@code StructuredTaskScope} can be used to ensure that the lifetime of a concurrent
 * operation is confined by a <em>syntax block</em>, just like that of a sequential
 * operation in structured programming.
 *
 * <h2>Basic usage</h2>
 *
 * A {@code StructuredTaskScope} is created with one of its public constructors. It defines
 * the {@link #fork(Callable) fork} method to start a thread to execute a task, the {@link
 * #join() join} method to wait for all threads to finish, and the {@link #close() close}
 * method to close the task scope. The API is intended to be used with the {@code
 * try-with-resources} construct. The intention is that code in the <em>block</em> uses
 * the {@code fork} method to fork threads to execute the subtasks, wait for the threads
 * to finish with the {@code join} method, and then <em>process the results</em>.
 * Processing of results may include handling or re-throwing of exceptions.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope<Object>()) {
 *
 *         Future<Integer> future1 = scope.fork(task1);   // @highlight substring="fork"
 *         Future<String> future2 = scope.fork(task2);    // @highlight substring="fork"
 *
 *         scope.join();                                  // @highlight substring="join"
 *
 *         ... process results/exceptions ...
 *
 *     } // close                                         // @highlight substring="close"
 * }
 * To ensure correct usage, the {@code join} and {@code close} methods may only be invoked
 * by the <em>owner</em> (the thread that opened/created the task scope}, and the
 * {@code close} method throws an exception after closing if the owner did not invoke the
 * {@code join} method after forking.
 *
 * <p> {@code StructuredTaskScope} defines the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut
 * down a task scope without closing it. Shutdown is useful for cases where a subtask
 * completes with a result (or exception) and the results of other unfinished subtasks are
 * no longer needed. If a subtask invokes {@code shutdown} while the owner is waiting in
 * the {@code join} method then it will cause {@code join} to wakeup, all unfinished
 * threads to be {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupted} and prevents new threads
 * from starting in the task scope.
 *
 * <h2>Subclasses with policies for common cases</h2>
 *
 * Two subclasses of {@code StructuredTaskScope} are defined to implement policy for
 * common cases:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> {@link ShutdownOnSuccess ShutdownOnSuccess} captures the first result and
 *   shuts down the task scope to interrupt unfinished threads and wakeup the owner. This
 *   class is intended for cases where the result of any subtask will do ("invoke any")
 *   and where there is no need to wait for results of other unfinished tasks. It defines
 *   methods to get the first result or throw an exception if all subtasks fail.
 *   <li> {@link ShutdownOnFailure ShutdownOnFailure} captures the first exception and
 *   shuts down the task scope. This class is intended for cases where the results of all
 *   subtasks are required ("invoke all"); if any subtask fails then the results of other
 *   unfinished subtasks are no longer needed. If defines methods to throw an exception if
 *   any of the subtasks fail.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> The following are two examples that use the two classes. In both cases, a pair of
 * subtasks are forked to fetch resources from two URL locations "left" and "right". The
 * first example creates a ShutdownOnSuccess object to capture the result of the first
 * subtask to complete normally, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the task
 * scope. The main task waits in {@code join} until either subtask completes with a result
 * or both subtasks fail. It invokes {@link ShutdownOnSuccess#result(Function)
 * result(Function)} method to get the captured result. If both subtasks fail then this
 * method throws a {@code WebApplicationException} with the exception from one of the
 * subtasks as the cause.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnSuccess<String>()) {
 *
 *         scope.fork(() -> fetch(left));
 *         scope.fork(() -> fetch(right));
 *
 *         scope.join();
 *
 *         // @link regex="result(?=\()" target="ShutdownOnSuccess#result" :
 *         String result = scope.result(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 * The second example creates a ShutdownOnFailure object to capture the exception of the
 * first subtask to fail, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the task scope. The
 * main task waits in {@link #joinUntil(Instant)} until both subtasks complete with a
 * result, either fails, or a deadline is reached. It invokes {@link
 * ShutdownOnFailure#throwIfFailed(Function) throwIfFailed(Function)} to throw an exception
 * when either subtask fails. This method is a no-op if no subtasks fail. The main task
 * uses {@code Future}'s {@link Future#resultNow() resultNow()} method to retrieve the
 * results.
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *    Instant deadline = ...
 *
 *    try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
 *
 *         Future<String> future1 = scope.fork(() -> query(left));
 *         Future<String> future2 = scope.fork(() -> query(right));
 *
 *         scope.joinUntil(deadline);
 *
 *         // @link substring="throwIfFailed" target="ShutdownOnFailure#throwIfFailed" :
 *         scope.throwIfFailed(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *         // both subtasks completed successfully
 *         String result = Stream.of(future1, future2)
 *                 // @link substring="Future::resultNow" target="Future#resultNow" :
 *                 .map(Future::resultNow)
 *                 .collect(Collectors.joining(", ", "{ ", " }"));
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <h2>Extending StructuredTaskScope</h2>
 *
 * {@code StructuredTaskScope} can be extended, and the {@link #handleComplete(Future)
 * handleComplete} overridden, to implement policies other than those implemented by
 * {@code ShutdownOnSuccess} and {@code ShutdownOnFailure}. The method may be overridden
 * to, for example, collect the results of subtasks that complete with a result and ignore
 * subtasks that fail. It may collect exceptions when subtasks fail. It may invoke the
 * {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut down and cause {@link #join() join} to
 * wakeup when some condition arises.
 *
 * <p> A subclass will typically define methods to make available results, state, or other
 * outcome to code that executes after the {@code join} method. A subclass that collects
 * results and ignores subtasks that fail may define a method that returns a collection of
 * results. A subclass that implements a policy to shut down when a subtask fails may
 * define a method to retrieve the exception of the first subtask to fail.
 *
 * <p> The following is an example of a {@code StructuredTaskScope} implementation that
 * collects the results of subtasks that complete successfully. It defines the method
 * <b>{@code results()}</b> to be used by the main task to retrieve the results.
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     class MyScope<T> extends StructuredTaskScope<T> {
 *         private final Queue<T> results = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
 *
 *         MyScope() {
 *             super(null, Thread.ofVirtual().factory());
 *         }
 *
 *         @Override
 *         // @link substring="handleComplete" target="handleComplete" :
 *         protected void handleComplete(Future<T> future) {
 *             if (future.state() == Future.State.SUCCESS) {
 *                 T result = future.resultNow();
 *                 results.add(result);
 *             }
 *         }
 *
 *         // Returns a stream of results from the subtasks that completed successfully
 *         public Stream<T> results() {     // @highlight substring="results"
 *             return results.stream();
 *         }
 *     }
 *  }
 *
 * <h2><a id="TreeStructure">Tree structure</a></h2>
 *
 * StructuredTaskScopes form a tree where parent-child relations are established
 * implicitly when opening a new task scope:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> A parent-child relation is established when a thread started in a task scope
 *   opens its own task scope. A thread started in task scope "A" that opens task scope
 *   "B" establishes a parent-child relation where task scope "A" is the parent of task
 *   scope "B".
 *   <li> A parent-child relation is established with nesting. If a thread opens task
 *   scope "B", then opens task scope "C" (before it closes "B"), then the enclosing task
 *   scope "B" is the parent of the nested task scope "C".
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The tree structure supports:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Inheritance of {@linkplain ExtentLocal extent-local} variables across threads.
 *   <li> Confinement checks. The phrase "threads contained in the task scope" in method
 *   descriptions means threads started in the task scope or descendant scopes.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The following example demonstrates the inheritance of an extent-local variable. An
 * extent local {@code NAME} is bound to the value "duke". A StructuredTaskScope is created
 * and its {@code fork} method invoked to start a thread to execute {@code childTask}.
 * The thread inherits the extent-local {@linkplain ExtentLocal.Carrier bindings} captured
 * when creating the task scope. The code in {@code childTask} uses the value of the
 * extent-local and so reads the value "duke".
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     private static final ExtentLocal<String> NAME = ExtentLocal.newInstance();
 *
 *     // @link substring="where" target="ExtentLocal#where" :
 *     ExtentLocal.where(NAME, "duke").run(() -> {
 *         try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope<String>()) {
 *
 *             scope.fork(() -> childTask());           // @highlight substring="fork"
 *             ...
 *          }
 *     });
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     String childTask() {
 *         String name = NAME.get();   // "duke"    // @highlight substring="get"
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <p> {@code StructuredTaskScope} does not define APIs that exposes the tree structure
 * at this time.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 * <h2>Memory consistency effects</h2>
 *
 * <p> Actions in the owner thread of, or a thread contained in, the task scope prior to
 * {@linkplain #fork forking} of a {@code Callable} task
 * <a href="../../../../java.base/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility">
 * <i>happen-before</i></a> any actions taken by that task, which in turn <i>happen-before</i>
 * the task result is retrieved via its {@code Future}, or <i>happen-before</i> any actions
 * taken in a thread after {@linkplain #join() joining} of the task scope.
